            "Here is a clear step-by-step plan to accomplish the task:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Define Search Scope & Keywords:**\n",
            "    *   Understand that \"breakthroughs\" imply significant advancements, not minor updates.\n",
            "    *   Prepare initial search terms such as: \"AI breakthroughs 2024,\" \"top AI advancements 2024,\" \"major AI developments 2024,\" \"AI milestones 2024,\" \"impactful AI research 2024.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Identify Reliable Information Sources:**\n",
            "    *   Prioritize reputable technology news outlets (e.g., TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired, MIT Technology Review), AI research blogs from major companies (e.g., Google AI, OpenAI, Anthropic), academic news sections, and industry analysis reports. Avoid forums or unverified blogs as primary sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Execute Initial Searches:**\n",
            "    *   Use your chosen search engine (e.g., Google, Bing) with the keywords identified in Step 1.\n",
            "    *   Focus on results published or significantly updated *in* 2024. Be mindful that 2024 is ongoing, so some \"breakthroughs\" might be early announcements or significant progress on existing projects.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Filter and Evaluate Potential Breakthroughs:**\n",
            "    *   Scan headlines and introductory paragraphs for themes indicating significant novelty, impact, or a substantial leap forward in AI capabilities.\n",
            "    *   Look for developments that are widely reported across multiple reputable sources, which suggests broader recognition and credibility.\n",
            "    *   Prioritize developments that address limitations, open new possibilities, or demonstrate unprecedented performance in a specific AI domain (e.g., large language models, computer vision, robotics, ethical AI).\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Gather Details for Top Candidates:**\n",
            "    *   As you identify potential breakthroughs (aim for 5-7 initially), click through to the articles.\n",
            "    *   For each candidate, quickly extract:\n",
            "        *   The name or core concept of the breakthrough.\n",
            "        *   A brief understanding of what it does and why it's significant.\n",
            "        *   The URL of the source article.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Verify Recency and Significance:**\n",
            "    *   Double-check that the breakthrough was indeed announced or significantly advanced *in 2024*. If it's an ongoing project, ensure 2024 marked a major milestone.\n",
            "    *   Compare the impact of your candidates. Which ones seem to have the most profound implications for the field or for society?\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Select the Top 3 Breakthroughs:**\n",
            "    *   Based on your evaluation in Step 6, choose the three most impactful, novel, and well-substantiated breakthroughs. If there's overlap, try to pick distinct advancements.\n",
